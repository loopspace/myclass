	* myclass.cls: Rejigged the figure package loading so that color
	is not loaded if xcolor is already loaded.  Avoids issues with
	beamer.

	* myclass.cls: Added 'beamer' and 'beamerdefault' options to load
	the beamer class; default option loads it with certain default
	options (currently: 12pt, t, xcolor=dvipsnames, ignorenonframetext)
	The type of article produced by beamer is controlled by the
	filename (technically, the \jobname).  This should be of the form
	name.type(.tex) with no '.'s in the name.
