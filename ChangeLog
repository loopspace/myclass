	* myclass.tex: Test file for the myclass.cls style file.
	Currently focusses on titlepage and end-matter.

	* myclass.cls: Standardised the titlepage handling so that
	a journal option sorts the title page details into the correct
	places.  Current "journals" implemented are: amsart, lms, docmath,
	standard (article).  Also handles a certain amount of 'end matter'
	if the journal prefers addresses at the end of the document (needs
	to be right at the end, though), and bibliography style.

	Package requesting and unrequesting is now handled a little
	better, I think.  Options can now request a pacakge to be loaded
	or not loaded.  In conflicting circumstances, the request _not_ to
	load is preferred.

	TODO: the beamer and fig options are still relics of the old
	system and not fully integrated with the new.

	* myclass.cls: Rejigged the figure package loading so that color
	is not loaded if xcolor is already loaded.  Avoids issues with
	beamer.

	* myclass.cls: Added 'beamer' and 'beamerdefault' options to load
	the beamer class; default option loads it with certain default
	options (currently: 12pt, t, xcolor=dvipsnames, ignorenonframetext)
	The type of article produced by beamer is controlled by the
	filename (technically, the \jobname).  This should be of the form
	name.type(.tex) with no '.'s in the name.
